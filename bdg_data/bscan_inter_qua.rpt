The columns have the following meaning:
Designator: This is the main device designator.  If a device test has several
            test statements (e.g. diode tests on the emitter-base and
            base-collector junctions of a transistor) a sub-designator is added
Thr:        The threshold for determining an open or closed result.
O/C:        Open or closed, depending on the test.
Nom:        The nominal value in the test statement.
Low:        The lower limit in the test statement.
High:       The upper limit in the test statement.
Mean:       The mean of the values obtained by repeating the test.
StdDev:     The standard deviation of the obtained by repeating the test.
Margin:     The difference between the threshold and the closed measurements.
CPK:        The coefficient of producibility. CPK greater than 10 provides
            confidence in the producibility and stability of the test.
CP:         The minimum value where the CPK is determined by the limit 
	    closest to the mean.  CP is equal to CPK where the mean 
            is centered.  
# Bad:      The number of times the test failed. 
Flg:        These columns will have a warning flag character in the
            corresponding column (e.g. M if the mean is not centered in the
            limits band).
Com Ref:    This will allow the user to enter the comment number specified in
            the comment files.
