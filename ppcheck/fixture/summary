Inserted fixture part number "44200L" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

Trying to find a placement for the board that is compatible
   with the board handler.

Board "Superfuzz_AC_73-102898_01" has potential locations that are outside the probable area
   of the fixture.   Subsequent fixture software may have no alternative
   but to use some of these locations for probing to insure access to
   all nodes.  Selecting a new board placement could eliminate this
   problem. (WARNING BPL85)

The board "Superfuzz_AC_73-102898_01" was placed at X =  30198, Y = -77677
  with a rotation of  0.000 degrees.

Fixture Tooling has encountered local fixture component files.
   All subsequent fixture files will be generated based on the values
   provided. For the values used, refer to the Fixture Tooling section
   of "fixture/details" file. The physical relationship of these values
   is NOT judged by the system software.  This is an "override"
   situation and the user is responsible for the accuracy of all values
   entered.

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "P3V3_STBY" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 2.143.
            The standard deviation is 2.370.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2918 interface pins for 2385 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.817.
