     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 2.062.
            The standard deviation is 2.230.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2916 interface pins for 2386 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.818.
 No wires are being generated for this node. 
Check the fixture file, the old wirelist, and the test sources to make sure 
that the node names are correct.  Make sure that the appropriate .r files 
exist. (WARNING MPA404)

The last step resulting from this invocation of
"Develop Board Test" has been completed.  However, when the
dependencies were re-analyzed, using the new timestamps,
IPG Test Consultant determined that more steps need to be
done to completely develop the board test.  To finish developing
this board test, select "Develop Board Test" again, and execute
the indicated steps.  To avoid this problem in the future, be
careful about changing timestamps while IPG Test Consultant is
in the middle of "Develop Board Test".  If you must change the
timestamp of a file which is used by an earlier step, use "Cancel"
to exit the "Develop Board Test" menu, and then re-select
"Develop Board Test".  This will ensure that IPG Test Consultant
is always working with up-to-date dependency information.
Here is a list of the actions performed by IPG Test Consultant:
board placement

ipg from "ipgtc.tests"  !! Comprehensive regeneration
module pin assignment
